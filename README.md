# Facial Emotion Recognition for Retail Analytics

This project aims at determing facial emotions from cell phones at the retail store. The project deals with using multiple available datasets such as KDEF, RAF and FER2013 for emotion recognition. There are slight changes needed with RAF to load the data. The project uses Convolutional Neural Network with Dense Layer to determine the emotion of the person. It uses VGG 19 as the base model.

### Install Python 3.6 
### Clone this Repository 
```
git clone https://github.com/Tabish06/FERRA.git
```
### (Optional and Recommended) Set up a Python Virtual Environment 
### Install Tensorflow  
Note that this will require Python.
